This week was more about handling the everyday tasks to keep the projects moving.

As much as my ideas we listed too this week i didnt feel i made any signficant impact as i didnt have any results from my ideas play out quite yet.  They may but it was snice to at least be listened to and valued.  I just wish i had more action that could have taken place rather than good banter.
Could of done more, or even better this week.
Without exposure to the client and such limited time at the company the value of big impact hasn't been made very apparent to me. I feel accomplished when completing my tasks and feel my work is meaningful but have yet to translate that into a value of big impact on a personal level.
More internal facing work
all i have time for is absurd client requests.

We're in the middle of various studies, so I haven't been thinking about impact.
These are quarterly reports for a tracker, so they have big impact from a big picture perspective but not  necessarily when we are focused on the day to day.
Did not see
Our team has not done much as far as making strides with our clients this week. In my opinion.
kinda a routine week
see above
I did not directly experience this.
Was not involved in anything that I felt I was able to make an extensive difference.
