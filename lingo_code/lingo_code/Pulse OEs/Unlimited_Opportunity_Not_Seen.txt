I was out for some of the week, so I did not see this but I am sure it happened.

I'm new just getting started / trained - it's clear these values are here...
too much work to see the opportunity
I'm an SRM doing the same tasks I was doing as an RM. Our team has only 1 RM so it falls on the project leads (SRM's and even RD's) to do the tasks they should be passing off. This is frustrating and prevents us from spending quality time doing the So What? thinking we want to be doing. I am capable of much more than I am able to show off. We need to start at the bottom and give support each step of the way up if we want to grow at the rate Jeff and Dave want to.
same ol same ol..
I am not as involved with a lot of projects, so sometimes I do not encounter all of the values in one week. I definitely have seen all three values in my time here.

Work in progress for new opportunity
Actually, I have seen this... I'm helping out at Ted Talks tomorrow, which is a great opportunity!
all i have time for is absurd client requests.
We are just working on quarterly reports (22) for a tracking study - so just not a lot of room for going beyond what we need to deliver.
kinda a routine week
see above
I did not directly experience this.
